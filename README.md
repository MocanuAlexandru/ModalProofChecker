# ModalProofChecker
This project was my bachelor thesis, and is a program written in Haskell that check the correctness of a proof in modal logic.

A presentation for this project can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FocSWUvbolE16Me5Q_rMXpRYhzjwuzgB/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106969234120240097962&rtpof=true&sd=true

Some examples of modal proofs checked can be found in the file k-proof.hs
