    abstract="Resolution-based provers for multimodal normal logics require pruning of the search space for a proof in order to deal with the inherent intractability of the satisfiability problem for such logics. We present a clausal modal-layered hyper-resolution calculus for the basic multimodal logic, which divides the clause set according to the modal depth at which clauses occur. We show that the calculus is complete for the logics being considered. We also show that the calculus can be combined with other strategies. In particular, we discuss the completeness of combining modal layering and negative resolution. In addition, we present an incompleteness result for modal layering together with ordered resolution.",

    abstract="MleanCoP is a fully automated theorem prover for first-order modal logic. The proof search is based on a prefixed connection calculus and an additional prefix unification, which captures the Kripke semantics of different modal logics. MleanCoP is implemented in Prolog and the source code of the core proof search procedure consists only of a few lines. It supports the standard modal logics D, T, S4, and S5 with constant, cumulative, and varying domain conditions. The most recent version also supports heterogeneous multimodal logics and outputs a compact prefixed connection proof. An experimental evaluation shows the strong performance of MleanCoP.",
